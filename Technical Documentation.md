# 0. Define User Stories and Mockups

## Prioritized User Stories

### Must Have

* As a visitor, I want to register as either a client or a doctor, so that I can access the platform with the correct role.
* As a registered user, I want to log in securely, so that I can access my role-specific dashboard.
* As a client, I want to complete a guided nutrition questionnaire, so that the system can collect the data required to generate a personalized AI nutrition plan.
* As a client, I want to generate an AI-based nutrition plan from my questionnaire answers, so that I can receive a personalized diet structure based on my profile and goals.
* As a client, I want to review my generated plan including calories, macros, meals, and shopping list, so that I can follow the plan in a practical way.
* As a client, I want to make simple local adjustments such as:

  * replacing meals
  * replacing ingredients
  * making meals quicker
  * making them cheaper
    so that I can personalize the generated plan without requesting a new AI response.
* As a doctor, I want to submit a doctor application with my professional details and certificate file, so that the platform can review my eligibility.
* As a doctor, I want to view the current status of my submitted application, so that I know whether it is pending, approved, or rejected.
* As a client, I want to browse approved doctors and their contact details, so that I can request medical or nutrition support when needed.

---

### Should Have

* As a client, I want my AI plan session to remain available during the current browser session, so that I do not lose my questionnaire answers or generated plan while navigating.
* As a client, I want to view a lightweight history of previously generated plans, so that I can remember past plan summaries and dates.


---

### Could Have

* As a client, I want to switch the questionnaire output language preference, so that the generated plan matches my preferred language.
* As a client, I want additional assessment and support sections in my dashboard, so that I can explore more health-related platform features.
* As a doctor, I want a richer professional profile page, so that clients can better understand my background and specialty.


---


### Won’t Have (for the current MVP)

* As a client, I want to book appointments directly with doctors through the platform, so that I can manage consultations end to end.
* As a client, I want real-time chat with doctors, so that I can receive live support inside the application.
* As an administrator, I want an in-app review dashboard for doctor approval workflow, so that I can manage doctor applications from the platform interface.
* As a client, I want persistent full plan storage and retrieval from the backend, so that I can reopen complete historical plans at any time.


---

### High-Level Architecture Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U[User<br/>Client / Doctor] --> FE[Frontend<br/>React + Vite]

    FE -->|HTTP/JSON REST API| BE[Backend<br/>Django + Django REST Framework]
    FE -->|JWT access token in requests| BE

    BE -->|User, doctor application, platform data| DB[(PostgreSQL)]

    GROQ -->|Structured nutrition plan response| BE
    BE -->|JSON response| FE

    FE -->|Session-based temporary plan state| SS[Browser Session Storage]
```



## Data Flow

### 1. Authentication Flow

* The user interacts with the React frontend to register or log in.
* The frontend sends authentication requests to the Django REST backend.
* The backend validates credentials and returns JWT tokens.
* The frontend stores the authentication data locally and attaches the access token to protected API requests.

---

### 2. Role-Based Application Flow

* After login, the frontend routes the user based on role (`client` or `doctor`).
* Protected client and doctor pages communicate with the backend through authenticated REST endpoints.

---

### 3. AI Nutrition Plan Flow

* The client completes the multi-step questionnaire in the React frontend.
* The frontend normalizes the questionnaire answers and sends them to the backend AI Plans endpoint.
* The Django backend validates the submitted nutrition profile.
* The backend sends the profile to the **Groq API** for nutrition plan generation.
* Groq returns a structured plan to the backend.
* The backend returns the generated plan to the frontend.
* The frontend displays the plan and stores the current session state in browser session storage.
* Simple refinements such as:

  * replacing meals
  * replacing ingredients
  * increasing variety
  * making meals quicker or cheaper
    are handled locally in the frontend without sending another AI request.

---

### 4. Doctor Application Flow

* A doctor fills in the join form and uploads a certificate file from the frontend.
* The frontend sends a multipart form request to the Django backend.
* The backend stores application data in PostgreSQL.
* Verify doctor eligibility through system administrator.
* If the doctor is qualified, they will be added to the medical support as a doctor.
  
  ---

### 5. Medical Support Flow

* A client opens the Medical Support page in the frontend.
* The frontend requests the approved doctors list from the backend.
* The backend queries PostgreSQL and returns approved doctor records.
* The frontend displays doctor contact information to the client.

---

### Entity Relationship Diagram

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o| DOCTOR_PROFILE : has
    USER ||--o| DOCTOR_APPLICATION : submits

    USER {
        bigint id PK
        varchar username
        varchar email
        varchar password
        varchar role
    }

    DOCTOR_PROFILE {
        bigint id PK
        bigint user_id FK
        varchar specialty
        text bio
        boolean is_verified
    }

    DOCTOR_APPLICATION {

# 5. Plan SCM and QA Strategies

#### SCM Strategy

The project should use **Git** as the source control management tool, with a simple branch structure that supports ongoing MVP development and safe integration.

**Branching Strategy**

* `main`: production-ready code only
* `Dev`: integration branch for completed features before production release
* `Husaam-dev`, `Omar-dev`, `Mohammed-dev`, `Ali-dev`: developer branches used for implementing features, fixing bugs, and handling urgent production issues

**SCM Process**

* Each new feature or bug fix should be developed in its own branch.
* Developers should make small, regular commits with clear messages.
* All completed work should be submitted through a **Pull Request** into `Dev`.
* Pull Requests should be reviewed before merging.
* After validation in `Dev`, stable increments should be merged into `main`.

**Code Review Rules**

* Reviewers should verify:

  * correctness of business logic
  * API contract consistency between React and Django
  * role-based access control for `client` and `doctor`
  * input validation and error handling
  * no sensitive configuration values are hardcoded in production code
  * Pull Requests should not be merged without at least one review.

#### QA Strategy

The QA approach for this MVP should combine **manual testing**, **API testing**, **unit testing**, and **basic build validation**.

**1. Front-End QA**

* **Linting Tool:** ESLint
* **Current validation available:** `npm run lint`
* **Recommended tests:**

  * component tests for authentication screens
  * component tests for AI questionnaire flow
  * component tests for nutrition plan rendering and local edit actions
* **Recommended tools:**

  * React Testing Library
  * Vitest or Jest

**2. Back-End QA**

* **Current framework:** Django test framework is available, but automated tests are still minimal
* **Recommended tests:**

  * unit tests for serializers and permission classes
  * unit tests for AI profile validation and generated plan validation
  * integration tests for:

    * registration
    * login
    * current user endpoint
    * doctor application submission
    * approved doctors retrieval
    * AI plan generation endpoint
* **Recommended tools:**

  * Django `TestCase`
  * Django REST Framework API test tools
  * Postman for manual API verification

**3. Manual Testing for Critical User Flows**
The following flows should be tested manually in every major release:

* client registration and login
* doctor registration and login
* doctor application submission with file upload
* client AI questionnaire completion
* AI nutrition plan generation
* local meal/ingredient replacement actions
* approved doctor listing in Medical Support
* token expiry and refresh behavior

**4. API Testing**

* Use **Postman** to validate request/response behavior for all backend endpoints.
* Maintain a Postman collection for:

  * authentication endpoints
  * doctor application endpoints
  * AI plan generation endpoint

**5. Build and Deployment Validation**

* Frontend:

  * run `npm run lint`
  * run `npm run build`
* Backend:

  * run Django tests
  * verify migrations
  * verify environment variables such as database configuration and `GROQ_API_KEY`

#### Deployment Pipeline Plan

The project should use two environments:

**Staging**

* Used for integration testing before production
* Deployed from `Dev`
* Validates end-to-end flows with real backend/frontend integration

**Production**

* Used for final release
* Deployed only from `main`
* Requires successful review and staging validation before release

**Recommended Pipeline Stages**

1. Pull latest branch
2. Install dependencies
3. Run frontend linting
4. Run frontend build
5. Run backend tests
6. Apply database migrations
7. Deploy to staging or production based on branch

#### Summary

**SCM**

* Git-based workflow
* `main`, `Dev`, developer branches
* Pull requests and code review required before merge

**QA**

* ESLint for frontend quality checks
* Django test framework for backend validation
* Postman for API verification
* Manual testing for critical MVP user journeys
* Staging before production deployment
